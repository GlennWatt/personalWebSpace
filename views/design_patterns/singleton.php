- Head First Design Patterns<br /></p>

<b>What it means:</b><br />
<p>There isn't much going on here with the demo. Just two attemps at calling the instantiate class showing the code works. It should be noted if this solution is ported to a multi-threaded system (not likely in PHP) changes will need to be made.</p>

<div id="resultsDiv" class="contrast1" style="display: block;"><?=$this->singleton_data?></div>
